		<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p>
		<p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>

		<p>'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p>
		<p>Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grid_8">
		<p>'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p>
		<p>'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.</p>
		<p>'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March Hare.</p>

		<p>'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great many more than three.'</p>
		<p>'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.</p>
		<p>'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some severity; 'it's very rude.'</p>
		<p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p>

	<div class="grid_7 suffix_1">
		<p>'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.</p>

		<p>'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the March Hare.</p>
		<p>'Exactly so,' said Alice.</p>
		<p>'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p>
		<p>'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least—at least I mean what I say—that's the same thing, you know.'</p>
