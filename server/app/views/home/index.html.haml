    %h4 Overview
    %p
      As of today, we are opening up an internal beta of one of the Libra
      components:  Express.  This offering provides a free PHP, Ruby and
      Python hosting environment for software developers, similar to the
      Google App Engine or Heroku offerings.  At Summit, we will be
      expanding Libra with additional cloud services based on the work being
      done by the Makara team. But more on that as we get closer to
      Summit.

    %h4 Show Us Your Stuff!
    %p
      Now, we want to ask you for your talents.  We are opening an
      internal competition to harness your innovation to build an externally
      accessible application.  If you are a developer or designer, dust off
      the PHP and Rails books and build something.  If you are a hacker,
      breaking this stuff is in bounds, so give it your best shot.  Your
      contributions will be showcased both internally and externally at
      Summit to our customers.  But, in addition to fame, we will also be
      offering the following prizes:

    %p <strong>First Place:</strong>&nbsp;5 star Red Hat Reward + Libra T-Shirt
    %p <strong>Second Place:</strong>&nbsp;4 star Red Hat Reward + Libra T-Shirt
    %p <strong>Third Place:</strong>&nbsp;3 star Red Hat Reward + Libra T-Shirt
    %p <strong>Honorable Mention:</strong>&nbsp;Eternal fame + Libra T-Shirt

    %p
      Just a reminder that this effort is still <strong>Red Hat
      Confidential</strong>.  Your application will be public so please be
      sensitive about what you deploy.

    %h4 Contest Rules
    %p
      The rules are simple - send a quick write-up of what you have done
      to <a href="mailto:libra-list@redhat.com">libra-list@redhat.com</a>.  As a
      team, we will be voting on the submissions on April 15th and
      announcing winners.  We can't wait to see what you come up with!
