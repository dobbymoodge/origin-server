    %h2 What is Power?
    
    %p 
      Power can deploy applications to the cloud that are written to Linux (i.e. written in C, or using many binary components) whereas Flex and Express can only deploy applications written to web languages (Java, PHP, Python, etc). Similarly, Power can deploy applications which have no web front-end (e.g. trading systems, modeling systems, payment processing, client-server, messaging apps, etc).
