		<h4>Why do I have to register?</h4>
                <p>We want your experience to be very similar to our users.
                We have streamlined the registration process for our users, so
                let us know what you think.</p>

                <h4>Where is my data stored?</h4>
                <p>Whatever you put in this form is safely stored away in our
                corporate registration systems.  Your code will live in the
                clouds - your identity will not.</p>

		<h4>Will my instance be internal-only?</h4>
                <p>No! While the registration process is restricted to
                internal systems, the instance you create will be fully
                accessible outside the Red Hat network.  While this will allow
                for more flexible testing, please do not put any sensitive or
                confidential information on your instance.</p>
