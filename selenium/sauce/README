These are preliminary directions for getting our selenium tests to run in Sauce.

It is important that you use your own username because of the way Sauce handles tunnelling.
They allow one tunnel per sub-account (that's you).
These tests will work on your local machine as long as Rails is running (look at helper.rb).
I am going to make sure they work on a devenv as well.

1. Install sauce gem: 
  - gem install sauce
2. Configure sauce (with your credentials):
  - sauce config <USERNAME> <API_KEY>
3. Get Sauce-Connect JAR
  - curl -O http://saucelabs.com/downloads/Sauce-Connect-latest.zip && unzip Sauce-Connect-latest.zip
3. Run tests
  - ruby ts_web
