These are preliminary directions for getting our selenium tests to run in Sauce.

It is important that you use your own username because of the way Sauce handles tunnelling.
They allow one tunnel per sub-account (that's you).
These tests will work on your local machine as long as Rails is running (look at helper.rb).
I am going to make sure they work on a devenv as well.

1. Install required gems: 
  - bundle install
2. Configure sauce (with your credentials):
  - sauce config <USERNAME> <API_KEY>
3. Run tests
  - To run all tests: ruby ts_web
  - To run specific tests: ruby ts_web [home,ajax,etc...]

NOTE: If you plan on running multiple tests, run the Sauce-Connect.jar first and leave it running. 
 - java -jar Sauce-Connect.jar <username> <api_key>
The jar file will be downloaded the first time you run the test if it is not already in the sauce folder.
The test suite will find the tunnel and not start a new one, this should save some time.
