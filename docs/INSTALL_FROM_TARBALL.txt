Installing from tarball
=======================

First you need to make sure the following applications/libraries are available
on your system:

1) git
2) ruby
3) rubygems: json, parseconfig

NOTE: To check for rubygems, just run:

    # gem list json
    # gem list parseconfig

If either are missing you can install them with:

    # gem install json
    # gem install parseconfig

That's it, the above deps are installed, the rhc-commands should start
functioning, see USAGE.txt for more information.
