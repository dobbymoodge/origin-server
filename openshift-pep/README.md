This is the private PEP repository for OpenShift (public repository is
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-pep).  Private PEPs should have a
filename like:

    private-openshift-pep-001.md

Private PEPs and public PEPs have different numbers - only when a
private PEP is made public will the identifier be changed to be public.
I.e. there may be private-openshift-pep-001 and openshift-pep-001.
