Based on HTML5 Boilerplate, facilitated by the gem: https://github.com/sporkd/compass-html5-boilerplate

Just to make things interesting, all of the pertinent resources are written in helper languages,
if you will, instead of their target languages.

* All the relevant HTML documents' source files are Haml: http://haml-lang.com/
* The stylesheets are written to the Compass framework: http://compass-style.org/ based on Sass: http://sass-lang.com/
* The non-lib, non-plugin javascripts are written in CoffeeScript: http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script

Please keep edits to the source files (e.g. *.haml, *.scss, or *.coffee) instead of the target files, 
otherwise your edits will be overwritten the next time the source file is compiled! oh noes!
