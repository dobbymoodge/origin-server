        %strong repository
        that you'll use to check in changes to your application. When you
        %strong push
        a change to your Git repository we'll automatically deploy your code and restart your application if necessary.

    %p 
      Most of the capabilities of OpenShift are exposed through our command line tool, 
      %strong rhc.
      Whether it's adding cartridges, checking uptime, or pulling log files from
      the server, you can quickly put a finger on the pulse of your application.
      #{link_to "Follow these steps to install the client", getting_started_path(:anchor => 'install_client_tools')}
      on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
    %p
      After installing the command line tool follow our User Guide 
      #{link_to "on how to manage your application from the command line", manage_app_cli_user_guide_topic_url }

    -# cartridges
    %h2 Adding capabilities
    %p
      Cartridges are the components of an OpenShift application, and include databases, build systems,
      and management capabilities. #{link_to 'Adding a cartridge', application_cartridge_types_path(@application)}
      to an application provides the desired capability without forcing you to administrate or update that feature.
    %p
      To run a PHP application with MySQL (the M and P in LAMP) you 
      %strong embed
      the MySQL cartridge into your application. OpenShift gives your PHP code access to your new MySQL database, but
      manages the database server for you.
    %p
      You can see the 
      = link_to "list of available cartridges online", manage_cartridges_user_guide_topic_url
      or from the command line with
    %pre.cli
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          rhc app cartridge list
    %p
      You may also add a cartridge to your application by running

          rhc app cartridge add -a #{@application.name} -c <cart_id>
