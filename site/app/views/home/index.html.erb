        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>As of today, we are opening up an internal beta of one of the Libra
        components:  Express.  This offering provides a free PHP and Ruby on
        Rails hosting environment for software developers, similar to the
        Google App Engine or Heroku offerings.  At Summit, we will be
        expanding Libra with additional cloud services based on the work being
        done by the Makara team. But more on that as we get closer to
        Summit.</p>

        <h4>Show Us Your Stuff!</h4>
        <p>Now, we want to ask you for your talents.  We are opening an
        internal competition to harness your innovation.  If you are a
        developer or designer, dust off the PHP and Rails books and build
        something.  If you are a hacker, breaking this stuff is in bounds, so
        give it your best shot.  Your contributions will be showcased both
        internally and externally at Summit to our customers.  But, in
        addition to fame, we will also be offering the following prizes:</p>

        <p><strong>First Place:</strong>&nbsp;5 star Red Hat Reward + Libra T-Shirt</p>
        <p><strong>Second Place:</strong>&nbsp;4 star Red Hat Reward + Libra T-Shirt</p>
        <p><strong>Third Place:</strong>&nbsp;3 star Red Hat Reward + Libra T-Shirt</p>
        <p><strong>Honorable Mention:</strong>&nbsp;Eternal fame + Libra T-Shirt</p>
