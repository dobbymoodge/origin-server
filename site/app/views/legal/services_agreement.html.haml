Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create an employment or agency relationship between You and Red Hat (or any Red Hat personnel).  All headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for identification and convenience and will not be deemed part of this Agreement for purposes of interpretation. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason but would be valid and enforceable if appropriately modified, then such provision will apply with the modification necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If such provision cannot be so modified, the parties agree that such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement. The delay or failure of either party to exercise any rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights. No waiver will be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.  This Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, represents the final, complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter, notwithstanding any prior written agreements or prior and contemporaneous oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement.  Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that Red Hat may assign this Agreement without such consent to an affiliate or to any third party in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement relates.

          Domain Names.  
        In order to utilize some of the Preview Services, You may be required to create a unique domain name.  Your choice of name must be in conformance with the Acceptable Use Policy.  You may not use a name that, in Red Hat’s sole discretion, impersonates someone else, is or may be illegal, may infringe copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other proprietary rights, is vulgar or offensive or may cause confusion as to source, affiliation or endorsement.  Red Hat may, in its sole discretion, reject any domain name request submitted by You at any time, including after public use; acceptance of the domain name upon submission is not agreement by Red Hat that the domain name is in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph and does not obligate Red Hat to allow You to provide services at the domain name.  Red Hat reserves the right to  deactivate any domain name and require that You use a different domain name if Red Hat receives a notice by a third party that the domain name misappropriates or infringes a third party’s rights or if the domain name violates the terms of this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy or applicable law.
