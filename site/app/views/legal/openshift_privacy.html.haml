  %h2 Information We Collect and How We Use It
  %p
    When you register for OpenShift we collect some of the information listed in the Red Hat Policy.  We use that information to verify your identity when you log in to OpenShift, to provide the OpenShift services and as otherwise described in the Red Hat Policy.

These include to (i) investigate potential breaches of your agreements with Red Hat or to establish Red Hat’s legal rights or defend against legal claims, (ii) to detect, prevent or address fraud, technology or security issues, (iii) to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Red Hat, its users or the public or (iv) as required by law or regulation (such as responding to a subpoena, warrant, audit or agency action, and as described in the Red Hat Policy and your agreements with Red Hat).
