/*
  Draft CSS for the site

  Notes:

  $gridGutterWidth changes based on responsive layout - we need to have a single responsive style
  per element that depends on it (maybe define $gridGutterWidthLarge and use it in responsive.scss)

  SASS 3.0 doesn't support inlining media queries - we need to upgrade

  Continue to pull out variables

  Simplify login link behavior - lots of styles for fairly simple markup
