1.	Purpose
Red Hat designs programs for its partners ("Programs") to promote Red Hat Products, enhance the satisfaction of Red Hat's End Users and augment the expertise and resources of partners. Partner's participation in the Program(s) is governed by the following:

(a)	Partner Agreement including these Partner Terms and Conditions;
(b)	the applicable Program Appendix(ices) which have been agreed to by the Parties, including any End User License Agreements and Program Guide that may be referenced and/or incorporated into these documents; and
(c)	any transaction documents (subject to this Agreement) for Red Hat Products and/or Services (each, an "Order Form")

"Red Hat" means Red Hat, Inc. with a principal place of business of 100 East Davie Street, Raleigh, North Carolina 27601, U.S.A. Red Hat “Products" and “Services” mean the specific Red Hat branded offerings set forth in a Program Appendix. Red Hat and Partner are collectively referred to as the "Parties" and may be referred to individually as a "Party". "End User" is defined in the Program Appendices.

2.	Programs, Application Process, and Acceptance
Details of Programs, membership levels, specializations and qualifications for Partner participation in Programs and, if applicable, related Program Guides are included in Program Appendices, each of which may be amended by Red Hat from time to time effective seven (7) days after notice or as otherwise set forth in such notice. In particular, Red Hat reserves the right to change Programs, membership levels and/or specializations at any time, provided if you do not agree with the new terms, you may elect not to continue to participate in such Program or Program level.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, any subscriptions for Red Hat Products or Services purchased under a Program Appendix will commence upon the earlier of the first use of such Product or Service or the purchase date of such Product or Service.

3. 	Affiliate Authorizations
Partner’s Affiliate(s) may participate in the Program only upon (a) approval by Red Hat, including with regard to Program level and credit terms, and (b) execution of a written participation agreement with Red Hat or its Affiliate(s) to bind the Partner Affiliate to this Agreement. "Affiliate" means an entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common control or ownership with a Party, where "control" is the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

4. 	Territory
Partner may participate in the Program(s) only in the Territory designated in the Agreement.  Red Hat and Partner may elect to expand the Territory, add Affiliates and establish the different terms and conditions (e.g. currency, taxes, entities, etc.) by mutual written agreement, which may take the form of a Partner Acceptance Document or written participation agreement subject to this Agreement.

5.	Fees
Fees, if applicable, will be as indicated in each appropriate Program Appendix, and will be due and payable as set forth in such Program Appendix or Order Form subject to this Agreement.  All amounts owed under the Agreement are to be paid in US Dollars.

6.	Billing, Payment and Taxes
If Partner acquires Red Hat Products and/or Services directly from Red Hat, Red Hat will invoice Partner as set forth herein and may require receipt of a purchase order for any amounts due to Red Hat; provided, however, that any terms contained in such purchase order will not amend, supplement or modify the terms of the Agreement or be binding on Red Hat. Partner must pay all sums due to Red Hat net thirty (30) days from the date of invoice, without regard as to when or whether Partner collects payment from an End User. Partner will reimburse Red Hat for all costs and expenses incurred by Red Hat in connection with the collection of overdue amounts, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ or legal fees.  All amounts payable shall be exclusive of any Taxes. Partner will pay to Red Hat, in addition to any amounts due to Red Hat for Red Hat Products or Services, an amount equal to any Taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation sales, service, use or value-added taxes, which are paid or are payable by Red Hat or present Red Hat with a valid tax exemption certificate. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy, duty, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), exclusive of any taxes based on the net income of Red Hat. In the event of a cross-border transaction, should Partner be required under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to Red Hat, then the sum payable to Red Hat will be increased by the amount necessary to yield to Red Hat an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no withholdings or deductions been made. The parties will work together in good faith to minimize adverse tax consequences to Red Hat created by cross-border transactions. Any payments more than thirty (30) days past due will be subject to a late fee of one and one-half percent (1½%) per month, or the maximum rate allowable by law, whichever is less.

7.	Verifications
During the Term (as defined in Section 13.1) and for at least two (2) years thereafter, Partner will keep and maintain commercially reasonable written records and accounts regarding Partner’s use and distribution of the Red Hat Products and Services and business activities related to the Program(s) ("Records"). Red Hat may, at its own expense, verify such Records to determine Partner’s compliance with this Agreement. Such verification may take the form of requests for information, documents or records (with which Partner shall respond promptly), on-site visits (in respect of which Partner hereby grants the requisite access), or both.  Partner agrees to act reasonably and to cooperate with Red Hat in relation to such verifications.  Any on-site visit will occur during regular business hours at Partner’s offices, and will not interfere unreasonably with Partner’s business activities. For an on-site visit, Red Hat will give Partner at least ten (10) day’s prior written notice of the date of each visit.

8.	Trademarks
8.1	As used in this Agreement, the term "Red Hat Marks" means the trademarks owned by Red Hat or a Red Hat Affiliate that are set forth in each applicable Program Appendix. Red Hat grants Partner a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, revocable license in the Territory and during the Term to use the Red Hat Marks solely in connection with the marketing and distribution of the Red Hat Products as permitted in this Agreement, without the right to sublicense. Any other use of the Red Hat Marks is not permitted under this Agreement.

8.2	Partner agrees to use the Red Hat Marks only as stated in this Agreement, and in doing so, to follow the standards of quality established by Red Hat and to adhere to the trademark usage guidelines found at: http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/guidelines as amended from time to time and any other trademark terms found in any applicable Program Appendix (the "Red Hat Trademark Guidelines"). Partner agrees not to use the Red Hat Marks in combination with any other trade name, trademark or service mark without the prior written approval of Red Hat. Upon Red Hat’s request, Partner will provide Red Hat with representative samples of the use of Red Hat Marks contained within any materials including web pages, marketing, advertising, promotional and collateral materials ("Promotional Materials").

8.3 	If Red Hat determines that Partner is using the Red Hat Marks improperly, and/or in connection with goods or services not covered under this Agreement or outside of the Territory, Red Hat will notify Partner, and Partner will remedy the improper use within two (2) business days following receipt of such notice from Red Hat. Use of the Red Hat Marks other than as expressly permitted in this Agreement is a material breach of this Agreement, and Red Hat shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement. Partner agrees that any use of the Red Hat Marks after termination of the Agreement for any reason will cause Red Hat irreparable harm.

8.4	All goodwill created by the use of the Red Hat Marks by Partner is for the sole benefit of, and accrues to Red Hat. Partner acquires no right, title or interest in the Red Hat Marks or the goodwill associated with them, other than the right to use the Red Hat Marks according to this Agreement. In accepting this Agreement, Partner acknowledges Red Hat’s ownership of the Red Hat Marks, their validity and the goodwill connected with the Red Hat Marks. Partner will not challenge the validity of the Red Hat Marks, nor assist any one in challenging them. Partner agrees not to make any application to register any Red Hat Mark or any domain names containing a Red Hat Mark, and not to use or register any trade name, trademark, service mark, slogan, logo or domain name that is confusingly similar to, or a reference to, any Red Hat common law or registered trademark, trade name or service mark during or after the Term of this Agreement. At the request of Red Hat, Partner will execute any papers or documents reasonably necessary to protect the rights of Red Hat in the Red Hat Marks and will execute and deliver such other documents as may be reasonably requested by Red Hat. Partner’s use of the Red Hat Marks may not state or imply sponsorship or endorsement of Partner by Red Hat. Partner may not disparage Red Hat, Red Hat Marks or Red Hat Products. The right of Partner to use the Red Hat Marks will cease immediately upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and Partner must immediately discontinue use of the Red Hat Marks. If Partner becomes aware of any (possible or actual) infringement of the intellectual property rights of Red Hat it will immediately notify Red Hat in writing. This Section 8.4 will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.

8.5	Partner agrees that when using the Red Hat Marks in any documentation or Promotional Materials to include the following trademark legend: "[Name of Red Hat trademark] is a trademark of Red Hat, Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. Used under license." Red Hat’s trademark legend will be no less prominent that the trademark legend for Partner’s trademarks.

8.6	Packaging. Partner will not change or alter Red Hat packaging that houses Red Hat Products, including the graphic design appearing on such packaging or any labeling, words, logos, trademarks, pictures and collateral or other representations that appear on such packaging ("Packaging"). An alteration or change to Packaging includes, without limitation: (i) the application or attachment to Packaging of any material (e.g., labels, notes, seals, stamps, manuals, booklets, brochures, software packages, computer programs, compact discs, digital versatile discs, blue-ray discs, tapes, manuals and toys); and (ii) the marking of Packaging in any way. Any alteration or change to Packaging must be expressly authorized in writing by Red Hat, which authorization may be withheld or granted in Red Hat’s sole discretion.

9.	Additional Requirements

9.1	Red Hat reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement and all rights not expressly granted to the Red Hat Products and Services (including rights under any trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property of Red Hat). Partner will not use the Red Hat Products or Services to create an offering competitive with Red Hat, directly or indirectly, or for the benefit of any other person or entity or permit any third party to make such utilization, unless specifically agreed to in this Agreement. If Red Hat determines that any of the Services or Red Hat Products are being used (in whole or in part) by Partner in any way to (a) avoid paying fees that would otherwise be due hereunder, (b) provide Services to third parties outside of the scope of a Program or (c) create revenue without payment of fees to Red Hat for Red Hat Products or Services, Red Hat may immediately suspend performance and/or terminate the Agreement and any Program, and reserves its rights to exercise any and all legal and equitable remedies available to it under this Agreement or otherwise.

9.2	For each Red Hat Product (or Partner product that incorporates Red Hat Software) that Partner sells to an End User under a Program Appendix, Partner shall purchase the equivalent Red Hat Product with respect to such conditions as the term (1 or 3 years) and support level. For example, if the End User purchases a one year 24x7 support level Red Hat Enterprise Linux product from Partner, Partner shall purchase a one year Premium (24x7) Red Hat Product from Red Hat. Similarly, Partner is only authorized hereunder to resell the complete Red Hat Product it purchased and is not permitted to decouple the Red Hat Product or sell it in parts. For example, Partner will not purchase a 1 year Red Hat Product from Red Hat and then break it down into monthly or hourly increments for resale to the End User. Partner will work with Red Hat to ensure that its resale of the Red Hat Product to End Users is consistent with the guidelines of the Red Hat Products purchased.

9.3	Without limiting the generality of Section 9.1 or 9.2 above, Partner agrees: (i) not to modify the Red Hat Products in any manner; and (ii) not to use or resell the Red Hat Products in any manner or for any purpose not permitted by this Agreement, including, without limitation, for Partner's own internal or production use, other than as may be expressly permitted in the applicable Program Appendix or by any applicable mandatory rule of law. Should Partner desire to use the Red Hat Products for Partner’s own internal or production use other than as expressly permitted in the applicable Program Appendix, Partner agrees to purchase the appropriate Red Hat Product(s) under Red Hat’s standard terms for internal use, and to pay the applicable fee for all periods of use. This Agreement establishes the rights and obligations associated with Red Hat’s Programs, Products and Services, and is not intended to limit Partner’s rights to software code under the terms of an open source license.

10.	Intellectual Property
Partner acknowledges and agrees that all trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and all other intellectual and industrial property rights anywhere in the world, including moral rights, and all applications, provisional applications, registrations, continuations and renewals thereof, and all associated goodwill (present or future) in and to the Red Hat Products, are and will, as among the parties, be owned by and vested in Red Hat or its licensors, notwithstanding any use of terms such as "purchase," "sale" or the like within this Agreement.

Partner will indemnify and hold harmless Red Hat from any and all liability, losses, costs, damages or expenses, including reasonable attorney’s, solicitor’s or legal fees and costs, resulting from or arising out of third party demands or claims against Red Hat relating to any of Partner’s actions including, but not limited to, performance or non-performance under this Agreement.

To the extent permissible by law, the terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply, even where adopted as part of the domestic law of the country whose law governs the Agreement.

15.3.2 	Partner will comply with all applicable laws and regulations including all applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act (collectively, the “Anti-Corruption Laws”), and will not engage in conduct that would cause Red Hat to violate any law or regulation including the Anti-Corruption Laws.  Among other conduct, the Anti-Corruption Laws prohibit Partner, directly or indirectly, from receiving anything of value from, or offering anything of value to, either private parties or government or public officials with the intent that the recipient perform improperly a relevant function or activity or a person be rewarded for improper performance.  A government or public official includes employees and officers of a government agency, department or instrumentality as well as the employees or officers of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public international organizations, political parties and candidates for political office.  Partner represents and warrants that none of its significant shareholders, owners, partners, officers or directors (“Partner Officials”) is a government or public official and that if any of the Partner Officials becomes a government or public official, Partner will immediately notify Red Hat in writing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Partner will not permit its resellers or partners to do anything that would violate or cause Red Hat to violate any law or regulation including the Anti-Corruption Laws.  If Red Hat believes that Partner (or any of its resellers or partners) has breached or may breach any of the provisions of this Section or a notice is provided pursuant to this Section, Red Hat can immediately terminate the Agreement or stop performing its obligations (including making payments, if applicable) without any liability to Partner.

15.3.3	Partner agrees that it will not re-export the Red Hat Products, their components or related technical information received from Red Hat except as permitted by the laws and regulations of the United States of America and the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which Partner obtained the Red Hat Products or Services, their components or related technical information or that are otherwise applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, Partner will comply with applicable U.S. export laws, regulations and legal requirements. Partner acknowledges that the laws and regulations of the United States may restrict the export and re-export of certain commodities and technical information, including software, of U.S. origins.

15.3.4	As required by U.S. law, Partner represents and warrants that it: (a) understands that certain of the Red Hat Products, their components and related technical information are subject to export controls under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) is not located in any country listed in Country Group E:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR; (c) will not export, re-export or transfer the Red Hat Products, their components or related technical information to (1) any prohibited destination, (2) any end user who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government or (3) any end user who Partner knows or has reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or rocket systems, space launch vehicles, or sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle systems; (d) understands and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports, re-exports or transfers the Red Hat Products, their components or related technical information to eligible end users, it will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which include the name and address (including country) of each transferee; and (e) understands that countries including the U.S. may restrict the import, use or export of encryption products (which may include the Red Hat Products, their components or related technical information) and that it will be solely responsible for compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.

15.3.5	Partner will not export any Red Hat Product, component or related technical information to a third party or to an Affiliate that is located in a country that is engaged in boycotting activities not sanctioned by the U.S. and will not make any sale that is prohibited under the Anti-boycotting Act (50 USCA 2407, Part 760).

15.3.6	To the extent required by law or to protect the rights of Red Hat, Partner will register this Agreement, at its expense, with any governmental authority requiring such registration, or with which registration is advisable, provided that Red Hat will have the right to review and approve any application for registration prior to its submission to any governmental authority.  At Red Hat’s option, Red Hat may obtain such registration in its own name.  At Red Hat’s request, Partner will withdraw any application or registration of this Agreement that it has filed.

15.3.7	Partner acknowledges that Red Hat may be prohibited from providing Services (including maintenance and support) for Red Hat Products, their components and related technical information if Red Hat has knowledge that a violation of the EAR has occurred. The Parties agree to cooperate with each other with respect to any application for any required licenses and approvals; provided, however, that Partner acknowledges it is Partner's ultimate responsibility to comply with any and all export, import and use laws and that Red Hat has no further responsibility after the initial export to Partner.

15.4	No Assignment. This Agreement is only assignable by Partner with Red Hat’s prior written consent.  Any assignment made by Partner without Red Hat’s prior written consent will be void and Red Hat will not be required to recognize the assignment. Red Hat may assign any or all of its rights and delegate or novate any or all its obligations hereunder without the prior approval of Partner.  At the request of Red Hat, Partner will execute any papers or documents reasonably necessary to give effect to such assignment or novation.  Partner shall promptly notify Red Hat of any material change to its ownership structure.

15.5	Independent Contractor. Partner and Red Hat are independent contractors for all purposes, without express or implied authority to bind the other.  Neither Party nor its employees, agents or subcontractors is entitled to any employee benefits of the other.  Partner will be responsible for all costs and expenses incident to performing its business.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, or create a relationship of principal and agent between the Parties for any purpose.

15.6 	Force Majeure. Neither Party will be liable for nonperformance or delays caused by acts of God, wars, riots, strikes, fires, floods, earthquakes, government restrictions, terrorist acts or other causes beyond its reasonable control.  In the event of the occurrence of any of the foregoing, the date of performance will be deferred for a period of time equal to the time lost by reason of the delay.  This section does not relieve either Party of its obligation(s) to make payments.

16.	Miscellaneous.
(a) All headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for identification and convenience, and will not be deemed part of this Agreement for purposes of interpretation. (b) If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, but would be valid and enforceable if appropriately modified, then such provision will apply with the modification necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If such provision cannot be so modified, the Parties agree that such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Agreement. (c) The delay or failure of either Party to exercise any rights hereunder will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights. No waiver will be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party against whom such waiver or forfeiture is sought to be enforced.

OpenShift by Red Hat Partner
PROGRAM APPENDIX


1.	Purpose.  The OpenShift by Red Hat Partner Program (“OpenShift Partner Program“) is intended to provide assistance to partners who develop, deliver, and support commercial applications that are interoperable with Red Hat OpenShift (for example, an application that runs on Red Hat OpenShift ).  A separate written agreement between the Parties is required for a Partner that wishes to embed, sell and/or distribute Red Hat OpenShift within Partner’s OpenShift Ready applications or other products for sale or distribution to third parties (for example, a Partner that wishes to (1) embed Red Hat OpenShift with Partner’s applications) or (2) otherwise to sell or distribute Red Hat OpenShift to third parties.  Membership in the OpenShift Partner Program alone does not authorize a Partner to embed, sell and/or distribute Red Hat OpenShift with Partner’s applications for distribution to End Users or other third parties.

2.	Authorization. The Partner Agreement, including this Appendix, and the OpenShift by Red Hat Partner Program Guide set forth the terms and conditions under which Partner is authorized to participate in the OpenShift Partner Program.  Partner shall participate in the OpenShift Partner Program at the membership level for which Red Hat has approved Partner.  Partner’s continued authorization is based on its compliance with this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix, the Partner Agreement. This authorization is personal to the legal entity or branch office indicated by Partner in the application or as otherwise accepted by Red Hat in writing. Partner has no right to delegate its rights or obligations hereunder to a third party without Red Hat’s express written consent.

3.	Red Hat Products. For this OpenShift Partner Program and the Agreement, “Red Hat Product(s)” means Software (including, without limitation, any pre-released versions) obtained from Red Hat, directly or indirectly.  “Software” means Red Hat OpenShift provided by Red Hat and/or its Affiliates including all modifications, additions or further enhancements, in each case, which are delivered by or obtained from Red Hat, directly or via a third party, and in either binary or source code form or recompiled from source files which are obtained from Red Hat, directly or via a third party. Merely removing the Red Hat Marks does not change the fact that it is Software obtained from Red Hat nor does it eliminate any payment or other obligations to Red Hat.

4.	Interoperability.  Upon acceptance by Red Hat into the OpenShift Partner Program, Partner agrees to certify to Red Hat that certain of its applications are interoperable with Red Hat Products as set forth in the OpenShift Partner Program Guide.  Partner will conduct continuous testing of its applications to validate interoperability with the relevant Red Hat Product. Partner will also ensure that its staff has sufficient technical knowledge to support its applications running in combination with the applicable Red Hat Product. To facilitate such support, Partner may purchase Developer Support subscriptions from Red Hat which will entitle Partner’s developers to obtain technical support related to development issues from Red Hat.  Notwithstanding any assistance from Red Hat with development issues, Partner is solely responsible for the development and technical support of its applications. Partner represents and warrants that Partner will provide Red Hat with any required license rights to any software Partner provides to Red Hat under this Program at no charge to Red Hat.

5.	Red Hat CertifiedMaterials.  Red Hat and Partner agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to test Partner’s applications to be considered as interoperable with applicable Red Hat Product and potentially list such Partner Applications in Red Hat’s associated materials.  For purposes of this OpenShift Certification Program Appendix, an application that adheres to the Listing Criteria is called "OpenShift Ready."  With respect to each OpenShift Ready application, Partner confirms that (a) it will make each OpenShift Ready application generally available, and (b) Partner will provide support related to each OpenShift Ready application to End Users running the OpenShift Ready application with the applicable Red Hat Product. In the event that the Partner fails to support an End User running a OpenShift Ready application with the applicable Red Hat Product, Red Hat may, in its sole discretion, remove this application from the associated materials and require that Partner immediately cease use of the associated Red Hat Mark with respect to such application.

6.	 Internal Use of Red Hat Products to Support Certification of Interoperability.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Partner Agreement, including but not limited to Section 9, this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix and the OpenShift Partner Program Guide, Red Hat grants to Partner, and Partner accepts, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right during the OpenShift Partner Program Term to access and use the Red Hat Products solely to support Partner’s efforts to (a) test the interoperability of Partner’s applications with applicable Red Hat Products and (b) support End Users on issues related to the interoperability of OpenShift Ready applications with Red Hat’s Products.  If Partner, however, is using Red Hat Products in a production environment or for any other purpose, Partner agrees to purchase the applicable support subscriptions from Red Hat that entitles Partner to receive production support.

7.	Partner Marks. Partner grants Red Hat a license to include the name and logo of Partner in listings made available to the public that identify Partner as a participant in the Program.

8.	Red Hat Marks. The Red Hat Marks that Partner is authorized to use under this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix, if any, are identified in the OpenShift Partner Program Guide and are available electronically on the Partner Center or directly from Red Hat.

9.	OpenShift Certification Program Term.  This OpenShift Partner Program Appendix and the authorization granted hereunder begin on the Effective Date and continue for one (1) year (the “OpenShift Partner Program Term”). This OpenShift Partner Program Appendix shall automatically renew upon the anniversary of the Effective Date, and shall continue in full force and effect for successive one (1) year periods unless and until terminated by either party giving to the other party written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days before the anniversary date. “Effective Date” means either the date indicated on the Acceptance Notice or the date that Red Hat executed either a hard copy of the Agreement referencing this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix or a hard copy of this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix itself.

10.	Termination of OpenShift Partner Program Appendix by Red Hat or Partner.  Red Hat or Partner may (without prejudice to any other right or remedy) terminate this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix pursuant to Section 13.1 of the Partner Agreement. Termination of this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix shall not (a) affect any pre-existing agreements between the parties; (b) operate to terminate the Partner Agreement including any payment obligations thereunder; and (c) terminate Partner’s participation in other Programs. However, termination of this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix for any reason will immediately terminate Partner’s participation in the OpenShift Partner Program, including all eligibility for OpenShift Partner Program benefits. Unless otherwise authorized under a separate Program Appendix, upon such termination, Partner will immediately (i) cease referring to itself as a Red Hat OpenShift Partner Partner, and cease using that title in any communication and advertising; (ii) cease promoting any of Partner’s applications as OpenShift Ready applications; (iii) cease all use of the Red Hat Marks, (iv) return or destroy, at Red Hat’s option, all printed materials containing such Red Hat Marks, including all documentation.  All rights and obligations of the Parties under this OpenShift Partner Program Appendix will terminate immediately.
