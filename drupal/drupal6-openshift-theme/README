Setup information:
1) Running against OpenShift server
  settings.php should contain $conf['openshift_url'] = 'https://<hostname>', where <hostname is an openshift server with a copy of the latest theme.  OpenShift developers can start an EC2 instance and replace this URL.

2) Running without OpenShift server
  no config required, CSS will not be "up to date"

To generate a point in time CSS from OpenShift:
  echo "/* This content is generated */" > css/site.css
  cat ~/code/li/site/public/stylesheets/common.css >> css/site.css
  cat ~/code/li/site/public/stylesheets/site.css >> css/site.css
