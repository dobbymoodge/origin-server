Li Architecture
===============

The basic workflow is this:

Client => php webapp => mcollective rpc => mcollective server => \
    mcollective agent => local scripts (to create users, repos, etc)

Of the workflow above, the code is seperated as follows:

Client => client/
php webapp => php/
mcollective agent => backend/mcollective/
local scripts => backend/mcollective/cartridges/

The other bit missing is the facter facts located in:

backend/mcollective/facter/

The facter scripts only provide information (like the number of git repos on
a given host).  Facter doesn't make changes.  Mcollective, however, can use
these facts as filters or for searching using the mc-facts command.

Mcollective
===========

Mcollective, using the stomp protocol, is the messaging bus.  More information:
