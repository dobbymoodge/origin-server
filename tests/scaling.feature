Feature: Scaling Verification Tests
  Scenario Outline: AutoScale App
    Given the libra client tools
    When a scaled <type> application is created
    Then the haproxy-status page will be responding
    And the gear members will be UP
    And the <type> health-check will be successful
    When haproxy_ctld_daemon is started
    Then haproxy_ctld is running
    And 1 gears will be in the cluster
    When 25 concurrent http connections are generated for 90 seconds
    Then 2 gears will be in the cluster
    When the application is destroyed
    Then the application should not be accessible
    And the <type> health-check will not be successful

    And the gear members will be UP
    And the <type> health-check will be successful

    Then 2 gears will be in the cluster
    # This is doubled up to hit both gears
    And the <type> health-check will be successful
    And the <type> health-check will be successful
    When a gear is removed
    Then 1 gears will be in the cluster
    And the <type> health-check will be successful
    When the application is destroyed
    Then the application should not be accessible
    And the <type> health-check will not be successful

  Scenario Outline: Scaled App Cartridges
    Given the libra client tools
    When a scaled <type> application is created
    Then the haproxy-status page will be responding
    And the gear members will be UP
    When the haproxy-1.4 cartridge is removed
    Then the operation is not allowed
    And the haproxy-status page will be responding
    And the <type> health-check will be successful
