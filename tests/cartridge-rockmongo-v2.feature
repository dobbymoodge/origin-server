    Given a v2 default node
    And a new mock-0.1 type application
    And I embed a mongodb-2.2 cartridge into the application
    And an agent settings.py file is created

    Then 2 process named httpd will be running
    And the embedded rockmongo cartridge subdirectory named usr/rockmongo will exist
    And the embedded rockmongo cartridge log files will exist

    Then 0 processes named httpd will be running

    When I start the rockmongo-1.1 cartridge
    Then 2 processes named httpd will be running

    When I restart the rockmongo-1.1 cartridge
    Then 2 processes named httpd will be running

    When I destroy the application
