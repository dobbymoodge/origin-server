jbossas-7.0.0 cartridge build notes.

This cartridge is a collection of bash scripts under the info/hooks directory, along
with default configuration overrides for the standalone.xml and logging.properties.

It expects to have the jbossas-7.x application server installed under /opt/

The jbossas7.spec file can be used to create a source rpm from the jboss-as7 installation
tarball. Place the jboss-7.0.0.Beta2.tar.gz archive into the ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES directory,
the jbossas7.spec into ~/rpmbuild/SPECS, and run:

rpmbuild -bs jbossas7.spec

to create a ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/jboss-as7-7.0.0.Beta2-1.src.rpm source rpm.
