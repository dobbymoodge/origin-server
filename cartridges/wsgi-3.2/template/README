Repo layout
===========
wsgi/ - Externally exposed wsgi code goes
libs/ - Additional libraries
data/ - For not-externally exposed wsgi code
setup.py - Standard setup.py, specify deps here


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave wsgi, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.

setup.py
========

By adding dependencies to setup.py, OpenShift Express will automatically
download any libraries it cannot find in repo in libs/ (listed above in Repo
layout)
