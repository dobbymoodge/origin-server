Repo layout
===========
tmp/ - Temporary storage
public/ - Content (images, css, etc. available to the public)
config.ru - This file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application.
../data - For persistent data
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every push, just prior to
    starting your app


Notes about layout
==================
Every time you push, everything in your remote application path gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


Rails 3.0
===========

Option 1) (Recommended) Git push your application Gemfile/Gemfile.lock.  This will 
cause the remote OpenShift node to run bundle install --deployment to download and 
install your dependencies.  Each subsequent git push will use the previously 
downloaded dependencies as a starting point, so additional downloads will be a delta.

Option 2) Git add your .bundle and vendor/bundle directories after running 
'bundle install --deployment' locally.  Be sure to exclude any gems that have native 
code or ensure they can run on RHEL x86_64.
