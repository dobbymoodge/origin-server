Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Repo layout
===========
perl/ - Externally exposed perl code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For not-externally exposed perl code
../data - For persistent data
deplist.txt - A list of perl modules required to run
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every push, just prior to
    starting your app


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave perl, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


deplist.txt
===========

Adding module names to deplist.txt causes your remote OpenShift node to download
the required modules and install them.


Additional information
======================

Link to additional information will be here, when we have it :)
