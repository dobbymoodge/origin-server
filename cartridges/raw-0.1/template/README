Feel free to change or remove this file, it is informational only.

Repo layout
===========
static/ - Externally exposed static content goes here
misc/ - For not-externally exposed php code
../data - For persistent data (full path in environment var: OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR)
deplist.txt - list of pears to install
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every git push as part of the build process (on the CI system if available)
.openshift/action_hooks/deploy - Script that gets run every git push after build but before the app is restarted
.openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy - Script that gets run every git push after the app is restarted


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave the static directory in place (alter but do not delete) but feel
free to create additional directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


Environment Variables
=====================

OpenShift Express provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use.  The following list are some common variables but far from exhaustive:

    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']  - Application name
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_DIR']   - Application dir
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR']  - For persistent storage (between pushes)
    $_ENV['OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR']   - Temp storage (unmodified files deleted after 10 days)

To get a full list of environment variables, simply add a line in your
.openshift/action_hooks/build script that says "export" and push.
