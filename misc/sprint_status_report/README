Setup
=====
Make sure to run `bundle install`, since this project needs a few gems we don't normally use.

Run
===
  ruby -Ilib bin/process.rb

This will drop you into a pry shell which lets you test the reports before sending them.
(pry is a lot like irb, so you can do whatever you want to the objects or set variables)

Available Reports
=================
The following reports are defined (with their default variables)
* dev
  - Recipient: libra-devel@redhat.com
  - WILL send nag emails to US owners
* qe
  - Recipient: libra-qe@redhat.com
  - Will NOT send nag emails to US owners

Available Functions
===================
In both functions, the arguments are optional and will override the defaults.

Testing the Report
------------------
This command will print out the information the report will contain to your terminal
  <report>.test_email([to],[nag])

Sending the Report
------------------
This will email the default recipient (and US owners if nag is set or default)
  <report>.send_email([to],[nag])

Any problems
