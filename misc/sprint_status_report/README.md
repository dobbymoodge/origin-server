Setup
=====
Make sure to run `bundle install`, since this project needs a few gems we don't normally use.

Run
===

	./sprint_status_report

Use `--help` for more options

Reports
================
Below are the reports that are defined, as well as the default settings for who to send the report to and whether to "nag" the story owners with individual emails.

The following assumptions are made

1. Stories that need QE means they **DO NOT** have the `no-qe` tag
1. Design stories never require QE
1. Stories that have QE notes means that there is some text in the notes section like, `[libra-qe]`, `tcms`, or `QE`
1. Dcut is currently defined as day 8 and can be changed in `config/rally.yml`

Overriding DCUT
===============
The DCUT date may be overridden by specifying a note in the current
iteration (can be the iteration for any of the teams).
Simply specify:

  ```
  DCUT: YYYY-MM-DD
  ```

Adding Notes
============
Similarly to DCUT, other notes in the iterations will be included in the
emails as well.
