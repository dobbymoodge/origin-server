1. Create the environment variable LIBRA_DEV which will prefix a verifier as
your own:
  export LIBRA_DEV='mhicks'

2. Create your test instance.  By default it will create an instance, upload
the current tests to it and run them.
  rake ami:verify:start

3. Login to the node to run specific tests / debug.  Here are some common commands
that can be run from /root:

  Run all verification tests
    cucumber --tags @verify li/tests/

  Run a specific test scenario (i.e. the one starting on line 55)
    cucumber li/tests/verification.feature:55

4. Check out the output logs
  Test output - /tmp/rhc/cucumber.log
  Rails logs - /var/www/html/libra/log/*

5. If you make some local test changes and want to push them up to your verifier, run
  rake ami:verify:update

6. There is also the li-log-util utility that you can use to clear out logs
and archive them up as well (i.e. to attach to a Bugzilla)
