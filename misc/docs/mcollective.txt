* In devenv there is no puppet servers so the keys are baked into the rh-devenv rpm.  In prod, they should not be needed.
** in the rh-devenv rpm, the client certs are created in /etc/mcollective/ssl/clients
*** When dropping in production you need to adjust the /etc/qpidd.conf file and add the qpid ports in iptables.  It works with the stock selinux policy.  You will also need to make-certs.sh and copy them around.
