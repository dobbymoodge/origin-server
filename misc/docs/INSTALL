Simple Setup
============
Note: this is the "just get me up and running" section.  Everything from
Overview and below is the hard way.

The easy way?

Create a RHEL6 x86_64 instance on ec2.
copy and run ../scripts/li-devenv.sh

done, you can now create users and apps.


Overview
========

The basic overview of what needs to be setup is this
1) Install and configure activemq
2) Install and configure node/mcollective
3) Install and configure controller
4) Install a cartridge
5) Create user
6) Create a project

The directions below are for an "all in one" solution where the node,
controller and message bus are all on the same machine.  These directions
are designed for RHEL6 on ec2.  Other systems should work if you can find the
applications.  To run on non-ec2 see the non-ec2 section below.

Note about DDNS
===============

This setup assumes DDNS is already setup.  DDNS is outside the scope of this
document.  Bind is a good DDNS server.  You can read more at:

http://linux.yyz.us/nsupdate/

DDNS is not required in a strict sense to get libra up and running.  When new
applications are created, they are available at some localhost IP and a port.


Prereqs
=======

You'll need access to RHEL6, RHEL6-optional and EPEL packages.  If you're on ec2
follow the steps below.  If you're building locally, you'll need RHEL entitlements.

Make sure you have the optional and epel repos enabled:
rpm -Uhv http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm
rpm -e rh-amazon-rhui-client
rpm -Uhv http://209.132.178.9/gpxe/trees/li/rhel/6/x86_64/rhel6-and-optional-0.1-1.noarch.rpm

Install and configure activemq
==============================

1) Copy the misc/li.repo file to /etc/yum.repos.d/
2) Run "yum install activemq activemq-info-provider"
3) Copy misc/activemq.xml to /etc/activemq/activemq.xml
4) Start activemq: service activemq start


Install and configure node/mcollective
======================================

1) run "yum install mcollective mcollective-client li-node"
2) edit /etc/mcollective/server.cfg
    - Set the plugin.psk line to something unique, remember it
    - Point plugin.stomp.host to localhost
3) edit /etc/mcollective/client.cfg
    - Set plugin.psk line to what you set in server.cfg
    - Set plugin.stomp.host to localhost
4) Start mcollective - service mcollective start
5) Confirm mcollective is working by issuing a ping:
    mc-ping
6) Confirm /etc/libra/node_data.conf exists.  If not run
    service libra-data start
7) Edit /etc/libra/node.conf and set the following items:
    - libra_domain: The DDNS domain to alter
    - resolver: IP address of your master DDNS server
    - secret: The secret key information for DDNS updates
    - unobfuscate: Set to 1 in dev environments (makes debugging easier)


Install and configure controller
================================

1) run "yum install li-server rubygem-builder"
2) Add your EC2 key and secret to /etc/libra/controller.conf
3) Create libra bucket (log in to amazon or use s3cmd and create a bucket called libra
4) Create a new user by running:
    /usr/bin/rhc-new-user -n namespace -l <rhlogin> -s ssh_key
    NOTE: "ssh_key" in this case must just be the payload portion of an RSA ssh
    key. (exclude the ssh-rsa from the begining and the comment / email from the end)
5) After running the command from 4) make note of the uuid that is printed to the screen
6) add the following crontab to root's cron tasks (crontab -e)
    * * * * * /usr/bin/puppet /usr/libexec/mcollective/update_yaml.pp

Prep Host for httpd access
==========================
1) add port 80 as being open in /etc/sysconfig/iptables
2) enable httpd relay in selinux - "setsebool -P httpd_can_network_relay=on"
3) Uncomment the line in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf that starts with "NameVirtualHost"
4) start httpd and make sure it starts on reboot "service httpd start; chkconfig httpd on"

Install a cartridge
===================

1) run "yum install rhc-cartridge-php-5.3"
2) run "rhc-cartridge-do -a configure -n li -l $rhlogin --cartridge php-5.3" -p <password>
    Note: "rhlogin" should be the same rhlogin you used earlier
    Note: "uuid" is the uuid you got fro step 5) in "install and configure controller"
3) Confirm the site comes up at li.namespace.domain_specified earlier
    Note: If you do not have ddns setup, you can check /etc/libra/id_db for the
    localhost and port number.

Finalize setup
==============
1) edit ~/.ssh/config and add an entry like:
Host li.<userid>.rhcloud.com
   User <user uuid>
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/libra_id_rsa
2) From your local git li repo run "git push ssh://<user uuid>@li.<userid>.rhcloud.com/var/lib/libra/<user uuid>/git/li.git master" and you should be able to see the source pushed to http://li.<userid>.rhcloud.com/
3) From the root of the li repo run cp ./client/express.conf ~/.openshift
4) edit ~/.openshift/express.conf and change "libra_server = 'li.beta.rhcloud.com'" to "libra_server = 'li.<userid>.rhcloud.com'"


That's it
=========

If all of the above steps worked you should be able to use Li.  Once installed
by RPM it shouldn't be too difficult to install via local Rakefile for
development.  "rake install" should do it.


Non-ec2
=======

To run on non-ec2 you need to alter /etc/libra/node_data.conf and set instance_id
and public_ip to the IP of your host.
