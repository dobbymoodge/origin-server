To develop on the Rails site locally, there are a couple of steps you need to
do.

First - decide if you are going to work with an integrated setup or not.  By
default you will not be integrated with IT's corporate systems.  Any
registrations will essentially be 'trusted'.  This is configurable though if
you want to try logging in as real users.

Developing on laptop - integrated
1. edit development.rb and search for 'Integrated Streamline'.  Uncomment the
appropriate section to enable integration testing.  If you are in AWS, you
need to use the AWS settings to allow the calls to be routed over the reverse
proxy.

2. yum install mod_ssl
This will install apache certs you will need

3. cd server/public; mkdir app; cd app; ln ../* .; rm app
This should link all the resources in public into /app/public

4. cd server; sudo rails s

5. Set an entry in /etc/hosts for
127.0.0.1 openshift.redhat.com

This will get you setup pretty well to test the site locally.

Running the tests

1. cp misc/devenv/controller.conf to /etc/libra/controller.conf
2. cd server
3. rake test

Running a specific test

1. ruby -Itest/ test/functional/home_controller_test.rb
