1. Setup the server and client libraries
  yum install qpid-cpp-server qpid-cpp-client ruby-qmf

2. Disable qpid authentication in /etc/qpidd.conf by setting
  auth=no

2. Start the process
  service qpidd start

3. Replace the following sections in /etc/mcollective/client.cfg and
/etc/mcollective/server.cfg:

  connector = stomp
  plugin.stomp.host = localhost
  plugin.stomp.port = 6163
  plugin.stomp.user = mcollective
  plugin.stomp.password = marionette

 with:

  connector = amqp
  plugin.amqp.url = localhost:5672
  plugin.amqp.ha-url = localhost:5674

4. Restart MCollective to load the new plugin

  service mcollective restart

5. Test by running (you should get at least one result)

  mco ping

6. You probably want to setup the client logger in /etc/mcollective/client.cfg
  logfile = /var/www/stickshift/broker/log/mcollective-client.log

7. For debugging, you also want to set 'loglevel = debug' in both /etc/mcollective/client.cfg and /etc/mcollective/server.cfg
