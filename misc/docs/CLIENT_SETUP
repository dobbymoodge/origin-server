Clone the git repos:

git clone ssh://git1.ops.rhcloud.com/srv/git/li

-----------
OS X Notes:
-----------

To just run the client, you basically need:
  ssh
  git
  ruby + gems

OS X 10.6 comes w/ ssh, but not with git or ruby, unless you have
Xcode 4.0.x installed (as a developer you should have Xcode anyway).
Even so, we suggest using either MacPorts or HomeBrew to download
and install git and ruby+gems.

Now obtain the client code, either via 'git clone' as above
or via the rhc gem.

-------------
More Setup:
-------------

yum install mcollective-common mcollective-client rhc rubygem-right_aws rubygem-aws

edit ~/.openshift/express.conf and point libra_server your broker system

sudo mkdir /etc/libra
sudo cp server-common/conf/libra/controller.conf  /etc/libra
