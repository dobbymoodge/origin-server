Clone the git repos:

Then, you can clone the git repositories with:

git clone ssh://git1.ops.rhcloud.com/srv/git/li

Example Usage:
rhc-create-domain -n <namespace> -l <rhlogin>
rhc-create-app -l <rhlogin> -a <appname> -r <Ex: /tmp/rhc/appname> -t php-5.3.2 -b
You should now be able to browse to:  http://appname-userid.rhcloud.com
Now make a change under /tmp/rhc/appname
git commit -a -m "Test commit"
git push
The change should be seen at:  http://appname-namespace.rhcloud.com

Running Test Cases:
rake cuc_int sprint[1]
tail -f /tmp/rhc/cucumber.log (To see log output)

OS X Notes:
-----------

To just run the client, you basically need:
  ssh
  git
  ruby + gems

OS X 10.6 comes w/ ssh, but not with git or ruby, unless you have
Xcode 4.0.x installed (as a developer you should have Xcode anyway).
Even so, we suggest using either MacPorts or HomeBrew to download
and install git and ruby+gems.

Now obtain the client code, either via 'git clone' as above
or via the li-client gem. At this point, the 'Example
Usage' follows exactly as indicated above.
