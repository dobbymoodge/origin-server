Clone the git repos:

OS X Notes:
-----------

git:
OS X 10.6 comes w/ ssh and ruby, but not with git, unless you have
Xcode 4.0.x installed (as a developer you should have Xcode anyway).
Xcode, however, is not free (unless you are a registered Apple
Developer) and costs around $5 from the Apple App Store.

If you do not have Xcode, you can obtain a pre-packaged version
of git from:

    http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

Installing git from MacPorts/HomeBrew/Fink/etc requires Xcode.

Now obtain the client code, either via 'git clone' as above
or via the rhc gem.

json_pure gem:
The client tools also make use of JSON as the data set for
I/O, and therefore needs the json ruby gem. Unless you have
Xcode installed, you will need to install json_pure, which
is the 100% ruby version of the JSON gem. If you have Xcode,
you can elect to install either json_pure or the native
json gem.
