Tito (https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito) is the tool that we use to coordinate
our RPM build strategy with git tagging.  Tito supports local builds to ease
development usage of RPMs as well as automatic submission to Brew / Koji.

Here is how you would use tito to build and release the 'broker' project.

# Get into the directory that has the appropriate spec
cd broker

# Make your changes
...

# Commit your changes
git commit -a -m "My changes"

# If you want to get an RPM built with your changes
# use the --test flag to build off the latest
tito build --rpm --test

# If your changes look good and you want to release
tito build --cvs-release

That's it!
