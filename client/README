Li
========

Thank you for helping test Li.  This is all non-production and still just a
proof of concept.  It could vanish at any time or possibly get merged into
another project.

Please stop by #libra on an internal mailing list if you run into issue.


Quickstart
========

DEPENDENCIES: git
              openssh-clients
              ruby (1.8.6 or later)
              rubygems
              json gem
              parseconfig gem

Step 1:  Create a li customer:

$ ./rhc-create-user -u desiredusername -e emailaddress

Step 2: Create a li application

$ ./rhc-create-app -u desiredusername -a appname -n /path/to/new/git/repo

Once that's complete, follow the directions printed at the end of running
rhc-create-app


Updating your site
========

Once your site is created, updating it is as simple as making changes to your
git repo.  Commit them, then push.  For example:

$ edit index.php
$ git commit -a -m "what I did"
$ git push origin master

Then just reload your web page to see the changes
